Currently, the following Hook specifications are provided in `kedro.framework.hooks`. Hooks look like the following:\n\n- `after_catalog_created`\n- `before_node_run`\n- `after_node_run`\n- `on_node_error`\n- `before_pipeline_run`\n- `after_pipeline_run`\n- `on_pipeline_error`\n- `before_dataset_loaded`\n- `after_dataset_loaded`\n- `before_dataset_saved`\n- `after_dataset_saved`\n\nThese should be defined/implemented in `hooks.py` and added to the Kedro project in `settings.py`\n"
